DJ-BaseSite was written in Python 2.7 and Django 1.4

Description:
DJ-BaseSite (or Django-BaseSite) is a customizable login and register system with required email activation. While most people just use django-registration, I decided to write my own to learn more about Django. 

NOTE TO DEVS:
A deactivation system hasn't been added. The login system needs to check attempts and display a CAPTCHA after a certain amount, this isn't included either. It also doesn't have an account recovery option. I plan to implement all of these things in future updates.

DJ-BaseSite is released under the New BSD License (The BSD 3-Clause License), refer to the LICENSE file.


Instructions
1. Install Python 2.7 (python.org) and Django 1.4 (djangoproject.com)
2. Open up the config.txt file and change the data under CUSTOM VARIABLES to your information. The configuration variable meanings are below.
3. Execute the SetupProject.py script and enter the project name, it will create a project based on your configuration.
4. Run the SyncDB script or "python manage.py syncdb" and create a super user.
5. Run the RunServer script or "python manage.py runserver" and check out your new website at localhost:8000 or 127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

DJ-BaseSite uses Recaptcha to prevent bots from creating accounts, so you'll need to get private and public keys from the website: http://www.google.com/recaptcha

Configuration Variable Meanings.

baseurl - It is used to create activation and deactivation links ( in views.py in register_user() )
